	<h1>Lab 4 - Introduction to HTML5</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>This week's lab will cover the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Configuring your development environment.</li>
        <li>Identifing the basic elements of a simple web page.</li>
		<li>Describing HTML syntax, tags, attributes and values.</li>
		<li>Entering and Formatting Text.</li>
		<li>Previewing Site Content in a Browser.</li>
		<li>Posting a web page to your web server.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Creating a GitHub account</h2>
	<p>Navigate to <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> and create an account using your own email address (if you don't already have one).  In the next steps you will be accessing GitHub classroom.  You will also be using git with Visual Studio Code to push your code (web pages) to github.com, where you will then pull them into your Apache web server.  These tools are all free, open source, and commonly used in web development.</p>

	<h2>Introduction to Git & Github</h2>
	<p>Use the following <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/h3HQxKIs">link</a> to set up your access to the Introduction to Git &amp; Github materials (provided by GitHub Classroom).  Read through and everything before you continue.  The purpose of this course is to familiarize yourself with Git &amp; Github.  To submit this, edit the instructions (README.md) by clicking on the pencil in the top right corner.  You may wish to complete any of the additional items under <strong>Optional next steps</strong>.</p>

	<h2>Downloading Visual Studio Code</h2>
	<p>The College PCs should all have Visual Studio Code and Git installed on them.  You will be using both of these tools to develop your website.  If you are working from home or your laptop however, you will want to install and configure both of these.  If you are working on a PC at Centennial College, skip to the next section (configuring Visual Studio Code).  You can download Visual Studio Code <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">here</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>Configuring Visual Studio Code</h2>
	<p>Visual Studio Code is a powerful editor designed for programming and scripting.  It is open source and available for free.  It also works cross-platform, meaning you can install it in Windows, macOS or Linux.  Additionally, it has source control tools for git and github built-in.</p>

	<h2>Creating your first web page</h2>
	<p>Before creating your first web page, it's best to lay out the required structural tags (an example follows).  You can then fill in the rest of the data using this simple template.  Remember, a web page is everything that exists between the opening and closing html tags (&lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt; respectively).  It consists of two main parts:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>The head, consisting of everything between the head tags (&lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; respectively).  This section contains information about the document, and won't appear on the page itself.</li>
		<li>The body, consisting of everything between the body tags (&lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt;).  This section contains the document itself, everything in here will appear as your web page.</li>
	</ol>

	<pre>
	&lt;html&gt;
		&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;/head&gt;
		&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;/body&gt;
	&lt;/html&gt;
	</pre>
	
    <p>Create a new file named <em>index.html</em> and fill in the structure using the above sample.  This is the file you'll be editing for the rest of the lab.</p>
	<h2>The document type declaration</h2>
	<h3>Add the doctype</h3>
	<p>The document type declaration tells the browser what type of document to expect.  There are many different doctypes, however for this course we will be using the one for HTML5.  Add the following to your webpage above the opening HTML tag (the doctype declaration must be the first thing in your document).</p>

    <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</pre>


	<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp">W3Schools</a> has some useful information on the different doctypes and their uses.</p>

	<h2>Filling in the head</h2>
	<h3>Add a title</h3>
	<p>Add the title of "Lab 1" (without the quotes) to the header section of your document.</p>

    <pre>&lt;title&gt;Lab 1&lt;/title&gt;</pre>

	<h3>Add some meta tags</h3>
	<p>Meta tags provide additional information about our page.  These include what character encoding you're using, and data used by search engines to index your page.</p>
	<p>Using the meta tag, define the character set as "UTF-8" (Unicode).  This tag defines metadata about the document, and can contain many attributes.  We will use several of them over the duration of this course.</p>

	<pre>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</pre>

	<p>Use the meta tag to add author information to your web page (with the content of your name).  An example follows.</p>

	<pre>&lt;meta name="author" content="Linus Torvalds"&gt;</pre>

	<p>The header can contain many other things such as embedded or external links to CSS or JavaScript, which we will visit later.</p>

	<h2>Filling in the body</h2>
	<h3>Add a heading</h3>
	<p>Headings when done properly should be used in number of importance, with 1 being most important and 2-6 used for sub-headings in order of descending importance.</p>
	<p>Insert the follwing using an H1 tag:<p>

	<pre>&lt;h1&gt;Your Name CNET204 Page&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>

	<h3>Add a paragraph</h3>
	<p>Using the paragraph tag (&lt;p&gt; to open and &lt;/p&gt; to close), add a paragraph below your heading about what you hope to learn from this course.</p>

	<h3>Comments</h3>
	<p>The comment tag can be extremely useful when you're first learning HTML, or when you have a large block of code and want to clearly define where it begins and ends.  Comments can make your code easier to read and understand, either by someone else or yourself after quite a bit of time has passed.  Comments are not used as frequently in HTML as they are in other languages.  To add a comment you require an opening (&lt;!--) and closing (--&gt;) tag.  A sample follows below, please feel free to include comments in your labs whenever you encounter something that may be useful to remembering what you've learned later.</p>

	<pre>&lt;!-- This is a comment, it's contents will only appear when you view the page source through the browser. Comments in HTML can span multiple lines. This is not always true of comments in a other languages, and some can even have a variety of methods for designating a comment --&gt;</pre>

	<h3>To do:</h3>
	<p>Using what you learned about comments above, add a comment indicating your name and student number as the first line of the body.</p>
	
	<h2>Completing the Lab</h2>
	<p>To view your page, use the following URL (substituting your information where appropriate).  studentweb.cencol.ca/<em>firstpartofemail</em></p>
	<p>Your page should look similar to the following output.  If it does not, go back and complete whatever you've missed.</p>
	
    <img src="images/lab1.png" alt="Lab 1 sample" />

	<p>Upon completion of this lab you should have a simple web page using several tags we talked about in our first lecture.  Your page should validate using the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">w3schools html validator</a>.  The following questions are for furthering your knowledge only, and may appear on quizzes or tests at any time later in this course.</p>

	<h2>Exploration Questions</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>What does html stand for?</li>
		<li>What are the two main parts of a web page?</li>
		<li>What sort of things appear in the header?  Which two did we use in this assignment?</li>
		<li>What sort of things appear in the body?  Which two did we use in this assignment?</li>
		<li>What is the range of heading tags?  Which is the biggest?  The smallest?</li>
		<li>How do you access your assignments (on the web server) in the browser?</li>
	</ol>
