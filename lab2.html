    <h1>Lab 2 - Introduction to Linux</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>This week's lab will cover the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Using the Linux Shell.</li>
		<li>Accessing help from the Linux command line.</li>
		<li>Editing the command line.</li>
		<li>Accessing command history.</li>
        <li>Navigating the Linux filesystem.</li>
		<li>Using command line text editors.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Using the Linux Shell</h2>
	<p>Servers are commonly configured to provide access to a command line interface (CLI) only.  Knowing how to use Linux from the commmand line is an important skill as a system administrator.  In this lab you will be learning how to use Linux using Ubuntu Server.  In Lab 3 you will learn how to install and configure Apache, which is an open source web server.</p>

	<h3>General Linux Command Structure is as follows:</h3>
	<strong>command argument1 argument2 ...</strong>

	<p>Some Linux commands can be issued by entering the Linux command line without arguments (e.g. pwd, date, ls, cal), but many Linux commands can be issued with arguments (e.g. cal 2002, cd /bin, ls -l -a /bin ).</p>

	<h3>What Does an Argument Represent?</h3>
	<p>An argument can respresent:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>a file pathname</li>
		<li>a command option</li>
		<li>a series of characters (i.e. text) that the command can use</li>
	</ul>

	<p>An argument is separated from a command (or from other arguments) by a SPACE, MULTIPLE SPACES or a TAB.</p>

	<h3>Perform the following steps:</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Start the AWS learner lab.</li>
		<li>Login to the Ubuntu Server instance (named first) using SSH.  You created this in Lab 1.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Issue the following command and observe the output:</p>
	<pre>pwd</pre>
	<p>The <strong>pwd</strong> command displays your current working directory.  In fact, pwd stands for print working directory.  Linux commands are commonly a short form describing the purpose they fulfill.  Knowing what the command means will help you remember the syntax.</p>

	<p>Issue the following command and observe the output:</p>
	<pre>ls</pre>
	<p>The <strong>ls</strong> command is used to list files.  Remember what you learned above about commands describing the purpose they fulfill.  You will find it useful time and again.</p>

	<p>Now lets try something a little more challenging.  Issue the following commands:</p>
	<pre>cd /bin</pre>
	<pre>pwd</pre>
	<p>Based on the output of the pwd command, what do you think <strong>cd /bin</strong> did?</p>

	<p>Issue the following commands and note the differences between them.</p>
	<pre>ls</pre>
	<pre>ls -l</pre>
	<p>You just used an option.  Options modify the output of the command.  Commands have many options.  You will get to know some through common usage.  Try each of the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Try issuing the cd command again, but without any option.</li>
		<li>Now issue the pwd command again.  Notice what happened.</li>
		<li>Lets try adding a different option to the ls command.  Issue the following:</li>
		<pre>ls /bin</pre>
		
	</ul>
	<p>Note, you can provide the directory you wish a file listing of without having to change to that directory first. Try combining options by issuing the following:</p>
	<pre>ls -l /bin</pre>

	<p>Our screen has gotten a bit cluttered.  Why don't we clear it?</p>
	<pre>clear</pre>

	<p>Now try the following command:</p>
	<pre>who</pre>
	<p>Who isn't going to display very interesting output in our particular case.  The <strong>who</strong> command shows you who is currently logged on to the system.  In our case, the only user connected to your instance is going to be you.  In a production environment though, who can provide some extremely useful information.</p>

	<p>Issue the following command:</p>
	<pre>whoami</pre>
	<p>What does this command display?</p>

	<p>Issue the following command and observe the output:</p>
	<pre>cal</pre>
	<p><strong>cal</strong> can be a pretty useful command too.  In fact, it takes options to make it even more useful.  Try the following.</p>

	<p>Issue the command:</p>
	<pre>cal 2023</pre>

	<p>Now with some different options:</p>
	<pre>cal 9 2023</pre>

	<h2>Accessing help in Linux</h2>
	<p>There are many different commands in Linux.  In fact, there are over <strong>2500</strong> different commands and utilities.  It is important to be able to know where to look for help, so you can learn as you go.  You will always be discovering new things in Linux, no matter how long you have used it.  Fortunately, the man command (short for manual) provides useful information such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>command usage</li>
		<li>acceptable command arguments</li>
		<li>command options</li>
		<li>examples</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There is even a man page for the man command!  Issue the following command to view it's contents.</p>
	<pre>man man</pre>

	<p>Once you are in the man page you can navigate through them using the following methods:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>ENTER</dt>
			<dd>Moves down one line.</dd>
		<dt>SPACEBAR</dt>
			<dd>Moves down one screen.</dd>
		<dt>ctrl + b</dt>
			<dd>Moves up one screen.</dd>
		<dt>/pattern/</dt>
			<dd>Searches for the word pattern within the man page.  You can use this to search for words within a man page.</dd>
		<dt>q</dt>
			<dd>Quit the man page.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>Feel free to browse through the man page for the man command if you wish.  Press <strong>q</strong> to quit when you are ready.</p>

	<h3>To do:</h3>
	<p>Using what you have learned, access the man page for the <strong>ls</strong> command.  Browse through and make note of the following options:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Use a long listing format</li>
		<li>Do not ignore entries starting with . (which are hidden files)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Return to your home directory and issue the <strong>ls</strong> command for each of the options you just learned.  Note the differences in output.</p>

	<h2>Editing the command line</h2>
	<p>Shortcut keys allow you to increase your productivity by doing things more efficiently (with less key strokes).  In this section you will learn a few common Bash shortcuts.</p>
	<p>Type the following command but do not press the ENTER key:</p>
	<pre>cd /bin</pre>
	<ul>
		<li>Press <strong>ctrl + a</strong> at the same time and observe what happens.</li>
		<li>Now try <strong>alt + f</strong> at the same time.  Repeat this a second time.</li>
		<li>Press <strong>alt +b</strong> at the same time.  What happened?</li>
		<li>Press <strong>ctrl + w</strong>.  What did this do?</li>
		<li>Type <strong>ls</strong> followed by <strong>ctrl + e</strong>, and hit enter to execute the modified command.</li>
		<!-- ctrl + u, ctrl + l -->
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Accessing command history</h3>
	<!-- up arrow, history command-->
