	<h1>Assignment 2 - Fall 2023 - Due Friday, December 15th at 11:59pm</h1>
	<h2>Under Development</h2>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>In this assignment you are going to learn how to automate deploying a static website from GitHub to Amazon Web Services (AWS) using two services available in AWS: <strong>Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</strong> and <strong>AWS CodePipeline</strong>.  Steps for configuring these services and integrating them with GitHub are provided below.  You will then use this infrastructure to build and deploy a website according to the website specifications (see below).</p>
	
	<h2>Accepting the Assignment link to create your GitHub repository</h2>
	<p>Before you begin, Use the following <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/ggGjJD7F">link</a> to set up your Assignment 2 repository.  You wil be using this for Assignment 2.</p>
	<h2>Creating an S3 Bucket &amp; Configuring it for Static Website Hosting</h2>
	
	<p>Launch your learner lab and login.  Click on <strong>Services</strong> and navigate to <strong>Storage</strong> &lt; <strong>S3</strong> (see following screenshot).  You may want to add this to your favourites.</p>
	<img src="images/aws-access-s3.png" alt="Accessing S3">

	<p>You should see the following screen.</p>
	<img src="images/s3-bucket-name.png" alt="Giving your S3 bucket a name">
	
	<h3>Create your S3 bucket with the following configuration</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Give it the name: usernamea2 (where username is your Centennial username, ie: jcarman1a2).  Note: bucket names cannot contain spaces or upercase letters, and must be globally unique.</li>
		<li>Leave it in the default region.</li>
		<li>Make sure <strong>Block all public access</strong> is unchecked.</li>
		<li>Check <strong>Block public and cross-account access to bucket and objects through any public bucket or access point policies</strong>.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Create bucket</strong>.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Editing your S3 bucket properties</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Click on the hyperlink to your bucket under <strong>Name</strong>.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
		<li>Scroll to <strong>Static website hosting</strong>, click Edit and enable it.</li>
		<li>Configure the following:</li>
		<img src="images/s3-static-website-hosting.png" alt="Configuring your S3 bucket to host a static website">
		<li>Don't forget to click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Setting the permissions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) from your Bucket Properties tab (under <strong>Bucket overview</strong>).</li>
		<li>Scroll down to <strong>Bucket Policy</strong>, click Edit and enter the following:</li>
	</ul>

	<pre>
	{
		"Version": "2012-10-17",
		"Statement": [
			{
				"Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
				"Effect": "Allow",
				"Principal": "*",
				"Action": "s3:GetObject",
				"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::jcarman1a2/*"
			}
		]
	}
	</pre>


	<h2>Creating an AWS CodePipeline</h2>
	<p>Now that your S3 bucket is configured, you're going to use CodePipeline to implement a practice known as CI/CD - Coninuous Integration & Continuous Delivery/Deployment.  CodePipeline will allow us to take the code you push to your GitHub repository and automatically clone it to the S3 bucket you configured.  Your website will be deployed from there, with no server required.  To access CodePipeline:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Click on <strong>Services</strong></li>
		<li>Click on <strong>Developer Tools</strong></li>
		<li>Click on <strong>CodePipeline</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>You may want to add this to your favourites.  You should see the following screen:</p>
	<img src="images/aws-codepipeline.png" alt="AWS Code Pipeline">

	<p>Click on <strong>Create pipeline</strong>.  You should see the following screen:</p>
	<img src="images/aws-code-pipeline-settings.png" alt="AWS Code Pipeline Settings">
	
	<p>Configure the following options:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Pipeline name: <strong>youruserid-a2</strong> (ie jcarman1-a2)</li>
		<li>Under <strong>Advanced settings</strong> Select Custom Location, click on the <strong>Bucket</strong> input box and select your s3 bucket.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Click next.  You should see the following screen:</p>
	<img src="images/aws-codepipeline-add-source.png" alt="AWS Code Pipeline Adding a Source">
	<p>Under <strong>Source provider</strong> select <strong>GitHub (Version 1)</strong> from the drop down.  You'll get a warning about Version 2 being recommended, however you cannot use Version 2 with the learner lab.  Click <strong>Connect to GitHub</strong>.</p>
	
	<p>In the <strong>Authorize application</strong> window that opens, click <strong>Authorize aws-codesuite</strong> at the bottom.  Then <strong>Confirm</strong> on the next screen.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Under <strong>Repository</strong> select <strong>CNET204/assignment-2-yourusername</strong>.</li>
		<li>Under <strong>Branch</strong> select <strong>Main</strong>.</li>
		<li>Under <strong>Change detection options</strong> make sure <strong>GitHub webhooks (recommended)</strong> is selected.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
		<li>Under <strong>Add build stage</strong> click <strong>Skip build stage</strong>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In <strong>Add deploy stage</strong> select <strong>Amazon S3</strong> from the <strong>Deploy provider</strong> list, and select your bucket.  Under <strong>S3 object key</strong> type in <strong>index.html</strong>, and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>

	<p>You should see a confirmation screen.  Click to continue.  You can now start adding code to your repostitory.</p>

	<h2>Creating a Website</h2>
	<p>Individually or (optionally) in a group of 2 (2 people would submit 1 website): You will complete a multi-page website using the tools and techniques we've covered in Labs 1-10.
